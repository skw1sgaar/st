# st: The simple terminal

This is a project from [suckless.org](sucless.org), where the aim is to make the simplest software possible. 

I use this, because it doesn't have any features that I won't use. I can configure and recompile them as I want. 

## Changes I have made

I wrote a script that should cleanly make the terminal, requiring only a restart of the terminal process to take effect

I also changed the font size. As it was tiny
